# Arduino-Projects
This repository's purpose is to contain and display my beginner Arduino projects. Later, it may involve more advanced microcontrollers but, for now, Arduino will be the board of choice.  Demonstrations of these projects can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC25ta2iPOl_kxzICu4X_svg
